# QUAD-for-Kernel-Density-Visualization-KDV-

QUAD is the short form of quadratic bound functions, which mainly support kernel density visualization and kernel density estimation (with low-dimensional setting, d<10). In this work, we show that the quadratic bound functions can be efficiently evaluated in O(d^2) time and are theoretically tighter than the state-of-the-art linear bound functions previous work, called KARL [1] (For more details about [1], please refer to https://github.com/edisonchan2013928/KARL-Fast-Kernel-Aggregation-Queries). As such, QUAD can achieve one-order-of-magnitude speedup, compared with the state-of-the-art method KARL.
